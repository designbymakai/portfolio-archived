          ðŸš§ Preparing the Auckland Community for the Worst
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          A goal-oriented interactive workshop that is tailor-made for the local
          Auckland community. Centred around engaging in activities that inform
          the participants of safety measures and precautions involving floods.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          This project stemmed from a design brief to create a workshop for the
          local community. My group and I executed a test version of the
          workshop with a small group of participants and received great
          feedback.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          The topic of flooding has been highly prevalent as Auckland has been
          hit with a few sizable floods in the past few years, and many people
          still need clarification on what to do if they were to be in such a
          situation.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          In association with my team, we developed a comprehensive document to
          illustrate the workshop's purpose, process, and outcome.
        </p>
        <iframe
          src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T1aR9H7OO_HBoithFjBW9UmPeIPcfILK/preview?usp=embed_googleplus"
          className="w-full h-screen"
        />
        <p className="py-6">
          The design brief had another aspect taking place after the workshop
          was conducted, involving the creation of social media posts to
          advertise the workshop.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          The brief specified two posts, one as a static image and one as a
          video or animation. My group and I split the workload, me working on
          the video as I had experience, and they worked to create a static
          post. However, we met to film the video together, where I wrote a
          script, directed the shooting, and later edited it to be a mock news
          segment.

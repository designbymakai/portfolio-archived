        <p className="py-6">
          Imagine a device that could determine the ripeness of your favorite
          fruits with just a scan. Well, Ripe does exactly that! Using advanced
          technology, Ripe analyzes the internal composition of each fruit,
          assessing factors like sugar content, firmness, and aroma to provide
          you with real-time information about its ripeness. No more guessing
          games or squeezing fruit like a detective on a mission!

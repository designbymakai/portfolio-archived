        <p className="py-6">
          Stress-Free is a game-changing product that provides support and
          stability for anyone struggling with isolation or anxiety. It's a
          portable device that uses air compression to simulate the feeling of
          holding a hand, giving you a comforting experience wherever you go.
          Unlike other options, Stress-Free is affordable, discreet, and
          accessible, making it a perfect companion for managing anxiety on the
          fly.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          The market for Stress-Free is huge, with an estimated 163 million
          people worldwide experiencing prolonged anxiety. In New Zealand alone,
          there are 1.9 million individuals who don't have access to anxiety
          treatment. Narrowing it down to Auckland, we're looking at around
          500,000 potential users, creating a market worth NZD 50 million.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          We've done our homework and spoken to mental health advocates,
          practitioners, and individuals who experience anxiety. They all agree
          that Stress-Free is a much-needed solution that can offer new ways to
          cope with anxiety. And let's be honest, who wouldn't want a portable
          stress reliever that feels like a warm hand-hold?
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          Our business model targets customers over 15 years old with anxiety
          disorders. We'll reach out to them through online channels, retailers,
          and mental health networks. We're all about building personal
          relationships and ensuring our customers feel connected to the brand.
          Social media, sponsors, mental health companies, word of mouth, and
          our website will help spread the word.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">
          Stress-Free positively impacts individuals and aligns with the UN's
          Sustainable Development Goal #3: promoting health and well-being for
          all. However, we're mindful of the environmental impact of the
          product's non-recyclable materials and will research ways to minimize
          it.
        </p>
        <p className="py-6">

          health field. We aim to provide accessible support, generate interest,
